# Hourly Visit Analysis

This repository contains a Python script that visualizes hourly visit counts for each day of the week across different months. 
The code generates bar charts to help understand the visit patterns throughout the day and month and hour.

## Description

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Generate Sample Data**:
   - Creates a dataset with hourly visit counts for an entire year.
   - Each entry includes the datetime, day of the week, and the number of visits.

2. **Prepare Data**:
   - Extracts hour and month from the datetime.
   - Prepares the data for visualization by categorizing it into days of the week and months.

3. **Create Visualizations**:
   - Uses `seaborn` to create bar charts that display hourly visit counts.
   - Generates a grid of plots where each row represents a month and each column represents a day of the week.

4. **Display and Save Plots**:
   - The plots are displayed using `matplotlib` with each chart showing the visit counts for every hour of the day.
   - Each plot is color-coded by the day of the week for clarity.

## Requirements

To run the script, you'll need the following Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
